      "what_content_private": "It is a vacation for all your senses. It is a 7 - 14 days long sailing tour for families or groups of friends. You will sail on a skippered sailing boat or a catamaran of your choice where a vegan cook will take care of all the meals, and a skipper will make sure you are safe and comfortable during your entire stay onboard.The whole itinerary is completely tailored  to your needs and wishes. This means you can choose the boat, date, and location of the trip, and, where necessary, let yourself be guided by advices from an experienced skipper.",
      "food_content_private": "Even though it does not seem so troublesome, not having a cook on board means you will have to take care of the grocery shopping, calculate 7- or 14-days food supply, and prepare all meals by yourself. This can be easy at home, but the boat kitchen usually means limited space for cooking and a lot of time spent on it, instead of relaxing or engaging in some other activity. And, usually there is no dishwasher on board! A simple solution we offer is a vegan cook who will plan your meals based on a preference sheet you will fill out before the trip.. If needed, you can communicate more details about your diet so that the cook can prepare all the meals just how you like them. We know how important is vegan diet to you. Our chefs will prepare delicious and nutritionally balanced vegan dishes that will fill your body with energy, and satisfy your taste buds. Carefully selected ingredients, with an emphasis on quality, freshness and seasonal variations, is what inspires the cooks when creating your meals. Some of the foods we use are: fresh fruits and vegetables (emphasis on the ones of Croatian origin), seeds, cereals, beans, whole meal flour and many more. We want you to experience new tastes, get ideas for the food preparation once you are home, and feel the vitality and energy you have gained from your meals thanks to the quality natural ingredients.",
