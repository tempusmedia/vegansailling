      PARAS will provide its participants general instructions for their safety and health. If necessary, the person must, prior to attending the program, consult with their physician.
      Depending on the cruise or program, activities may be strenuous, require staying on a boat for multiple days, possibly poor weather conditions and the effects of the sun, hence it is the responsibility of the participant to be physically and psychologically ready for such exertions.
      The participant is obligated to inform the skipper and other persons in charge at PARAS prior to the program commencing, of their illnesses, disabilities, allergies and/or other conditions that may pose an added risk to participants or possibly hinder them from completing the program. Such notice is necessary as it aims to protect the participant and need not pose an obstacle to properly participating in a program. The skippers are not qualified to provide medical assistance, but they may do so with the explicit permission of the participant and at the participant’s risk.
      All participants are personally responsible for protecting themselves against bad weather and the effects of the sun. The advice for sun protection is to wear a hat and sun glasses, as well as using high factor sun creams.
      The person declares at their own risk that they possess the appropriate swimming and sea survival skills.
      Despite all endeavors that PARAS invests in ensuring comfort, the participant accepts the fact that all programs include a certain level of risk and discomfort. PARAS does not assume any responsibility in case of injuries, damage, losses, additional costs, discomfort and the like incurred by the participant and/or personal equipment.

PARAS reserves the right to expel those participants that fail to behave in line with the stated procedures and actions or who, on account of their behavior, have brought upon other participants discomfort or risk, without any obligation by PARAS to provide compensation to expelled participants.
   The successful implementation of a program is based on a schedule to which participants must adhere. 
       </p>
    <p class="pt-5 font-semibold">       COMPLAINTS AND CLAIMS
